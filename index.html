<h1>Stage Zero:</h1>

<!-- first paragraph with bulitin points--!>
<b>How the internet works:</b> There are four main elements
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Users: write and control content
<LI>Computers: run browsers which understand and display HTML coding
<LI>HTTP: transfers data from one computer or server to another
<LI>Servers: large computers that store websites and data
</UL> </p>


<b>HTML & HTTP:</b>
<p>
HTML is the basic language of websites that make up the internet
<br><br>
HTTP is the transfering of HTML documents from one computer to another
</p>


<b>Elements and Tags:</b>
<p>
Elements are a group of tags and contents. For the most part all tags have<br>
a starting and a closing tag which define some attribute of the content.
</p>


<b>Inline & Block Attributes:</b>
<p>
Two attributes that are worth noting are inline and block. Inline are just that,<br>
a change that is inserted in the middle of the content. Blocks on the other<br>
hand create an invisible box around the content you are working with.
</p>

<!-- had to look up how to write a tag without creating a tag! --!>
<b>Tag Index:</b>
<p>
<ul> 
<li> &lt; em &gt; = emphasis = italics text
<li> &lt; a &gt; = Anchor = link
<li> &lt; imp &gt; = image
<li> &lt; br &gt; = line break (does not need a closing tag, known as &lt void &gt)
<li> &lt; UL &gt; = indent
<li> &lt; LI &gt; = bullet point
<li> &lt; b &gt; = bold text
<li> &lt; div &gt; = encapsulates elements
<li> &lt; p &gt; = paragraph
</ul></p>
